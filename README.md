# Coding Problems

Here you can find [solutions](#Solutions) for various coding/algorithmic problems and many useful [resources](#Learning-Resources) for learning algorithms and data structures.\
Also, this repo will be updated with new solutions from time to time.

*Note that this repo is meant to be used for learning and researching purposes only and it is **not** meant to be used for production.*


## Solutions

All solutions are written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) (more precisely, [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3)), using the [Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) (print, len, range, sorted, sum, min, max, etc...) and a few modules from the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) like:
- [math](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) (used for constants like math.pi, math.inf and functions like math.ceil, math.floor, math.gcd, math.log, math.pow, math.sqrt, etc)
- [collections](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html) (used for [collections.deque](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.deque) when there is a need for [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) or [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) data structures)
- [heapq](https://docs.python.org/3/library/heapq.html) (used when there is a need for [Priority Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) data structure).
- [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) (used for [nondeterministic algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_algorithm), like shuffling arrays).

So, to execute these solutions there is no need from installing any external packages. \
Coding style and name conventions are described in the official [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) page.

*Note that I'm **not** the author of these problems, they are from sites like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (you can find more than 40 sites like this in the [Training Sites](#Training-Sites) section). **Only** the solutions and explanations are mine.*

### Books

Several books that have made an impression on me:

1. [Grokking Algorithms by Aditya Bhargava](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22847284-grokking-algorithms-an-illustrated-guide-for-programmers-and-other-curio) - **The best** book for complete beginners in algorithms! I wish this book existed when I started learning algorithms.
2. [Introduction to Algorithms by CLRS](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6752187-introduction-to-algorithms) - This book is called "bible textbook of algorithms" by many programmers.
3. [Algorithms by Robert Sedgewick & Kevin Wayne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10803540-algorithms) - These authors are instructors of the previously mentioned coursera courses: [Algorithms Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) and [Algorithms Part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2). Also this book has excellent and free [site](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu) with exercises, presentations, and examples.
4. [The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/425208.The_Algorithm_Design_Manual) - The book describes many advanced topics and algorithms and it focuses on real life practical examples. This book has one of the best [site](http://www.algorist.com) with resources ([solutions](http://www.algorist.com/algowiki/index.php/The_Algorithms_Design_Manual_(Second_Edition)), [algorithms and data structures](http://www.algorist.com/algorist.html), [python implementations](http://www.algorist.com/languages/Python.html)).
5. [Algorithms by S. Dasgupta, C. Papadimitriou, and U. Vazirani](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/138563.Algorithms) - This book is an official book for algorithms and data structures classes in several famous universities.
6. [Competitive Programming 3 by Steven Halim & Felix Halim](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22820968-competitive-programming-3) - A great book that prepares you for competitive programming (not for complete beginners). You can learn many things and tricks about competitive programming. *But if your goal is to prepare for competitive programming then choose a faster language than Python, **C/C++** (or Java, it's faster than Python but not like C/C++).*
